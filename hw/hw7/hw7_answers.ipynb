This proportion, out of the 300 million + people living in the United States, is the population parameter of interest. Because it would be very expensive (if even possible) to ask every single person, we ask a random sample of people instead. If we take samples that are sufficiently large, the estimate will be close to the population parameter with high probability. However, this is not true for each individual sample. In some cases, we will select a sample in which the result is higher than the true value in the overall population. In other cases, we will select a sample in which the result is lower than the true value in the population. These differences are called sampling fluctuations. Because of sampling fluctuations, there is uncertainty associated with our estimate, which we can calculate. In this case, it is possible that the true proportion of Americans might be higher than 50%, even though this particular estimate was 47%.\n",
