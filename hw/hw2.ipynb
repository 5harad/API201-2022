    "Note that the WDI dataset reports GDP values in 2010 U.S. dollars, so that so you can directly compare values in different years.  Also note that GDP and population data are not available in some years.  For this problem set, use only those observations for which data are available.

It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2010 U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using 2010 official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used. |\n",
