        "\n",
        "As companies such as Amazon and Google continue to develop drones capable of delivering packages to the doorsteps of customers, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun to grapple with the regulatory implications of this new technology. As delivery drones will necessarily enter densely populated commercial and residential areas, the proximity of drones to people creates potentially dangerous situations. Additionally, package-bearing drones will be heavier, increasing the likelihood of serious injury when accidents do occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you are working for the FAA, with the responsibility to design a new set of regulations concerning drone safety technology. The FAA is considering an approach to limit the potential for a drone to hit someone on the ground and thereby prevent serious injuries. (You can read more about these developments [here](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/what-is-safe-enough-for-drone-deliveries/).) You are currently charged with analyzing two approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Mandating a parachute-recovery system on all delivery drones\n",
        "2. Mandating the parachute-recovery system and an advanced system of radar and other sensors designed to prevent collisions\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that neither approach will entirely remove the possibility of an accident.  As discussed below, there is a chance that either safety feature will fail, leading to injury.\n",
        "\n",
        "Safety systems are costly, of course.  Mandating a parachute-recovery system on all delivery drones is a relatively inexpensive approach, with a cost of \\$20 per drone. Estimates indicate that a delivery drone with only the parachute-recovery system has a 1.5 percent chance of a serious accident in its lifespan of use.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FAA’s second approach would be more expensive.  Mandating both the parachute-recovery system and the sensor system will cost a total of \\$80 per drone (\\$20 for the parachute-recovery system plus \\$60 for the sensor system). The upside is that the two safety features bundled together make the drone safer to operate: estimates indicate a drone with both features has only a 0.2 percent chance of a serious accident in its lifespan.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FAA estimates the average cost of a serious accident at \\$5,000, including potential medical costs to the injured party. If a drone is in a serious accident, it is subsequently decommissioned (and therefore a drone can only be in a maximum of one accident in its lifespan).\n",
        "\n",

Each spring, the town receives water through canals fed by the run-off from snowfall in the nearby Sierra Nevada mountain range.  As a result, the town has plenty of water in the spring.  But once the summer comes, the town may run low on water if there is drought and the run-off is less than expected.\n",

If the town has less than 80,000 acre-feet available – in other words, there is drought – it will cost the town \\$2 million during the summer to pump water into the town from alternative canals.\n",

        "\n",
        "For this pre-class exercise, think of a time in your personal or professional life in which you over-updated your priors, and a time in which you under-updated your priors. Note that your examples can be quantitative (that is, involving probabilities or other numbers) or qualitative (that is, not involving numbers but rather descriptions).  As we will discuss, the concept of \"thinking like a Bayesian\" is applicable in many types of situations, not just those in which you can use Bayes' rule. For the sake of diversity, please give examples that do not relate to medical testing.\n",
