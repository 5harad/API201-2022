## Outline

-   Fridays 12:00 PM -- 1:15 PM.

-   Goals:

    -   Review and expand on key concepts

    -   Prepare for homeworks using practice problems

    -   Develop R skills.

-   35 min concepts & 40 min on R.

## Expectations (for me)

-   I will do my best to make API201 interesting and informative.

    -   Review session is an opportunity to engage with your interests.

-   You can come to me with any questions you have about the course material, statistical methods, research more broadly, or graduate student life.

    -   Best times are before/after class and during office hours, but also feel free to message me on Slack with any questions/comments/concerns.

    -   I make myself as available as possible to answer questions (because I like helping out students!) but responses may be delayed if I'm busy with research or if you're messaging me after business hours.

## Expectations (for me)

-   Review sessions are **homework-focused**. I will cover material that you can directly apply to completing the homework assignment.

-   I don't grade the homework and can't comment on why you got a particular grade, but would be happy to help you work through any confusion with the material.

-   I will post review session materials in advance, but I encourage you to follow along with the lecture and write your own code for R exercises.

-   Guillermo and I work on review sessions materials together, so go to whichever session works better with your schedule.

## Expectations (for you)

-   Show up on time.

    -   Especially important because we try to make the materials interactive.

-   Engage with the material.

    -   You'll get the most out of review session if you and your peers are participating.

-   Be open-minded.

    -   Even if you're a stats-skeptic or stats-expert, we have a lot to learn from others.

-   Ask questions.

    -   It's always okay to be wrong! And this is the absolute best time to correct any misconceptions.
