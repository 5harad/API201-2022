## Outline

-   Fridays 12:00 PM -- 1:15 PM.

-   Goals:

    -   Review and expand on key concepts

    -   Prepare for homeworks using practice problems

    -   Develop R skills.

-   40 min concepts and practice probs & 35 min on R.

## Expectations (for me)

-   I will do my best to make API201 interesting and informative.

    -   Review session is an opportunity to engage with your interests.

-   You can come to me with any questions you have about the course material, statistical methods, research more broadly, or graduate student life.

    -   Best times are before/after class and during office hours, but also feel free to message me on Slack with any questions/comments/concerns.

    -   I make myself as available as possible to answer questions (because I like helping out students!) but responses may be delayed if I'm busy with research or if you're messaging me after business hours.

## Expectations (for me)

-   I don't grade the homework and can't comment on why you got a particular grade, but would be happy to help you work through any confusion with the material.

-   I will post review session materials in advance, but I encourage you to follow along with the lecture and write your own code for R exercises.

## Expectations (for you)

-   Show up on time.

-   Engage with the material.

-   Be open-minded.

-   It's always okay to be wrong!
