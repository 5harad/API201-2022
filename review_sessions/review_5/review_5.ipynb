    "\n",
    "Raw data is the original form of your data. It might be a dataset you downloaded from the internet, received from a partner, or came out of a survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your raw data will likely be a _tabular_ dataset with rows each corresponding to an observation and columns each corresponding to a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are likely already familiar with Excel files (`.xls` or `.xlsx`) as a way to structure tabular data. Another popular tabular data format is `.csv` (short for comma-separated values). Unlike Excel files, `.csv` does not allow formatting, equations, or multiple sheets. However, `.csv` files take up less space for a given amount of data and have no size limit. Excel can read `.csv` files, but if you want to format the dataset (e.g. set column widths) you'll need to \"Save As\" an `.xlsx` file from within Excel.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have downloaded raw data, you'll want to prepare it to be read into R. __For this exercise, we recommend saving all of your data in one Excel file.__ If your analyses use different units of observation, you will likely want to save them in different sheets within that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if one analysis of unemployment rates has states as units of observations and anonther analysis has counties as units of observation, we can create an Excel file `unemployment.xlsx` and paste state data into a sheet called `States` and county data into a sheet called `Counties`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "1. First row should only include variable names.\n",
    "    + Variable names should start with a letter and can contain numbers, letters, underscores, and periods.\n",
    "2. Each other row should contain one observation that corresponds to your unit of analysis.\n",
    "3. If there are variables from the raw data that you will not use in any of your analyses, you can remove them from \n",
    "3. Excel formatting can't be read by R."
