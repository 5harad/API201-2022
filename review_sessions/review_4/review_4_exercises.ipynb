    "The normal distribution is one of many different continuous distributions. There are _many_ different continuous distributions which are useful for modeling different phenomena: e.g. uniform, Student's t, chi-squared, pareto, F, beta, gamma, lognormal, truncated normal, exponential...\n",
    "\n",
    "But normal is an especially important distribution as you will see when we discuss the Central Limit Theorem, which makes much of statistics possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "With continuous distributions like the normal, we don't focus on the probability of a particular value happening, but rather a _range of values_. For example, we may be interested in the probability that rainfall is between 650mm and 675mm or the probability the Red Line train takes more than 10 minutes to arrive during rush hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a continuous distribution's __density__ and a range of values, we calculate the probability that a randomly chosen value falls in that range by totalling the area under the density function. From class, 68% of the area falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the area falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the area falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. More generally, you can calculate areas under the curve in R using the `pnorm()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distributions are usually parameterized with a mean (often denoted $\\mu$) and a standard deviation (often denoted $\\sigma$). A standard normal distribution has mean 0 and standard deviation 1. We can transform any normal distribution into a standard normal by subtracting each value by $\\mu$ and dividing by $\\sigma$. Doing so translates values into Z-scores, which provide a standardized measure of how far values diverge from the average:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if rainfall follows a normal distribution with $\\mu = 600$ and $\\sigma = 50$, the Z-score of 700mm is 2, and thus this outcome is 2 standard deviations away from the mean. 95 percent of the area under the curve is within 2 standard deviation of the mean, so only 5 percent of values are at least as extreme as 700mm."

For example, let $X_t$ be the amount of rainfall in year $t$. Then the expected amount of rainfall in 2023, 2024, and 2025 altogether is equal to sum of the expectations in each of those years: $E[X_{23} + X_{24} + X_{25}] = E[X_{23}] + E[X_{24}] + E[X_{25}]$.\n",
